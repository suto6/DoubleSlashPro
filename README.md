> **"Everyone searches for the fastest route, but who’s looking for the safest?"**

## 🛡️ What is Suraksha?

Suraksha isn’t just about getting from **Point A to B**—it’s about getting there **safely**. Our app prioritizes women’s safety by mapping the **safest routes**, avoiding crime-prone areas, and providing real-time crime awareness.

### 🔥 Key Features:

✅ **Safest Routes First**: Avoids areas with past crime incidents, ensuring a secure journey.  
✅ **Crime-Level Awareness**: Color-coded markers highlight risk zones instantly.  
✅ **Community-Powered Future**: Upcoming features will allow users to **report incidents** and help protect each other.  

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

Building a safety-first navigation app with **React Native Expo** had its hurdles:

🔹 **No Open-Source APIs**: We couldn’t find free, reliable APIs for real-time routing and device tracking.  
🔹 **Lack of Crime Data**: No publicly available datasets on crimes against women in **Kolkata** or other regions of India, so we had to **manually curate** our own data.  

Despite these challenges, we pushed through to build **Suraksha**, a step toward safer travel for women! ✨
